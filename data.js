    details:"I am presently the Head of Department of Water Resources and Climate (WRC). I graduated from the renowned Technological University (Federal University of Technology, Minna) with Bachelor of Technology Degree (B.TECH) in Geography with Remote Sensing. I obtained a Postgraduate Diploma in Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (PGD RS/GIS) from African Regional Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, Ile-Ife. Osun State. I later proceeded to the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) in Dehradun, Uttarakhand State in India under the full sponsorship of the Indian Government. (Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC)). I went to IIRS for 2 months Short Certificate Course in Remote Sensing with Special emphasis in Digital Image Processing. I believe I did so well and related to both our Resource Persons and all the 15 other Participants from some Countries like Mongolia, Romania, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Yemen, Palestine, South Sudan, Tanzania, Vietnam, Ethiopia, etc. I was unanimously nominated to respond and give a vote of thanks on behalf of all of us and was all highly commendable and appreciated especially the Resource Person. I have developed a passion for the Applications of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System in both Military and Security. I was recently redeployed from being Head of the Collaboration Unit to HOD WRC. I dare to say that I have made the most number of Presentations by far compared to any other Scientist in the Centre to the Military, (Army, Air Force, Navy, Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA)) Paramilitary, Police, Security Agencies and numerous Universities, etc. The Commandant of Nigeria Defence Academy wrote a Letter of Appreciation/Commendation to me through the Director's Office dated 11/May/2022. (NDA/AR/29/G) and it reads in part 'After the call they were given an incisive lecture by Mr Joshua Dang, Assistant Director. The lecture was conclusive in linking the imperatives of technology as warehoused in Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System to successful in the military and security spheres' My Presentations/Lectures have since formed Part of the Manual for teaching Cadet Officers in the Nigeria Defence Academy who have made it almost an annual visit of at least 5 times for my lectures in the Centre. Their visit to Jos Plateau is usually 3 days, I was reliably informed from their last visit 27/03/2024. The Cadet Officers recommended the total number of 3 days be spent for my lectures at next visits. I was nominated by the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, and our Headquarters (NASRDA) to represent and participate in the United Nations 51st COPUOS Meeting in Vienna, Austria. Presently in the Water Resources and Climate department we have started looking at the Earth which is referred to as the 'Blue Planet' because it is 70% covered by Water and water cannot be separated from climate. As a department we are already looking at the dynamism of the connection of water and climate on everything in the Earth, issues through Economic Importance like Water Resource Management, Climate Change, Melting Icebergs from the Polar Regions, Global Warming, Water Pollution, Wetland Losses, Rising Sea Levels, Treats to Coastal Landscapes, Underground Water Management, Cave Water Management, Treats of Desertification, Weather Phenomena like Hurricanes, Tornadoes, Flooding, Erosion through Water, Wind Erosion, Hydro-electric Power Generation, Wind Power Generation, Volcanoes and Earthquakes to Water and Climate, etc. My interest has always been the generation of Digital Terrain Models (DTM), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and Digital Surface Model (DSM). All these models assist in handling most Environmental phenomena. I am a good Image and Imagery Interpreter and love heights to understand the Terrain, little wonder I have conquered the Famous Wase Rock twice (1989 and 1991). This is a 365 metres above the ground level Inselberg in Wase Local Government of Plateau State. Nigeria.",
